\begin{abstract}
There are many tools required for engineering large and complex software products. There are also many areas in which they overlap. This project investigates and proposes a tool as a solution for the overlapping qualities of source code version control systems and issue tracking in software project development. 

Present state of the art software project issue tracking tools, such as GitHub, GitLab, and JIRA store issues in a database alongside the version control repository that contains the project's source code. This creates friction in development efforts because software developers must remember to keep both the issue tracker and the version control repository up to date as progress is made on completing tasks.

In the next generation of issue tracking we utilise the power of the version control system to conduct issue tracking such that developers can work on one source of truth. Using a Source Control Integrated Issue Tracking system aims to eliminate friction by providing an extension to the version control system that manages issues embedded within the source code. Developers are now able to update issue metadata, track progress and inspect the relationships between their issues and source code.  %Issues co-exist with commits as objects that are tracked.
