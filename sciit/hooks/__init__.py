@issue detecting duplicate ids
@title Detection of duplicate ids for an issue
@description
    The user should not be able to continue with a commit if there
    are duplicates of the same id within an issue tree.

    The issue tree will be the best place to store such an issue problem
    since the issue tree is the place that records the information about
    the list of issues within a commit.
